# Double-Dimension

SD:
This is a game
That is not so lame
Just hack into the mainframe
Without any shame

Exile:
Black ground, black walls,
Black player, black halls
There's only 10 levels
So you better beat them all

SD:
FRUITS.EXE was a dominator
Github is a complicator
Everytime I push
It always gives me a merging error

Exile:
We call this Double Dimension
At least that's the name for now
I know how to use Git Bash
But SD doesn't know how

SD:
I'm a programmer, a rapper,
But I'm no Git Basher
Exile's one of those,
And an excellant car crasher

Exile:
Yo, don't act like you know
You can't tell the difference between rice and snow
You think you're pro, but at least I know
How to spit fire while you spit play dough

SD:
凭什么你说我不会说唱 (What makes you an expert on whether I can rap)
影龙本人就是最棒    (I, ShadowDragon, is the best)
I bet you don't know what the heck I just said
But wipe yourself up, you're already dead

Exile:
At first we were describing what this game was like
All of a sudden it just turned into a fight.
The motto of this rap is to not fight with an Asian,
It's better to just be quiet and solve equations.
